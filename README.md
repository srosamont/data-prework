# Prework
*Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp*

## Introduction

This repository contains the prework for the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp, I did before starting the bootcamp. 
It is where my journey with Python starts.
It took about 2 weeks(full-time-equivalent) to complete this prework

## Getting Started


In the repository, you will find two directories: Python and Statistics. 

#### Python
To complete the Python exercises, navigate to the Python directory. This directory includes a bunch of folders, each with a problem for you to solve. Refer to the `README.md` file for further instructions.

#### Statistics
The statistics challenge consisted of completing the `Data Science Math Skills` course in Coursera, offered by Duke University. 
Though data science is in the name, the course teaches the core math upon which both data science and data analytics are built. I learned about set theory, math notation, probability theory, etc. 
In this file, you will fin all answers to  the `Practice Exercises` and `Quizes` I made for this `Data Science Math Skills` course.
